Introduction to Programming Languages Coding Final Project

I wrote code to find the nth fibonacci in two languages: mips and c++.
To compile mips I used a program called mars, which is included in the repository.
To compile the c++ code, I used Microsoft Visual Studio.

The main two paradigm differences between these two languages is:
	mips is imperative, shown by the loops and that each instruction for the program is given and it must go in order specified
	c++ is declarative, shown by how its for loops are written. I specify what the program should do and it determines the order.
	
	mips is an unstructured program in which there is little division of code and there is only one large block of code.
	c++ is structured where there can be a lot of division in the code. There can be different classes and functions defined.
		There is a fibonacci function in my code then a main section.
